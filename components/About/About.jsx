        <p className="text-tan text-lg lg:text-xl">
            I started my journey as a developer over 7 years ago. After studying Aerospace Engineering 
            in college with Computer Science as a minor, I decided that I&apos;d 
            have a more tangible and immediate impact on the world by pursuing software as a career. Since then, I&apos;ve 
            founded 4 tech startups and worked on countless independent projects. I&apos;m a curious thinker, lighthearted adventurer & enthusiastic teacher who is always seeking creative ways 
            to push the limits.
