The platform leverages a decentralized file storage infrastructure (Storj) and other Web3 technologies to store large media files more securely and at a fraction the cost of conventional cloud storage solutions. Files are encrypted in transit & at rest and erasure encoded for triple redundancy. My backend solution also utilizes multiple caching layers to minimize user bandwidth usage. I designed the application to give the user maximal control over the security vs accessibility of their files.",
